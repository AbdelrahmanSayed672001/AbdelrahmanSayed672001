Hi there 👋
🚀 About Me
👋 I’m Abdelrahman Sayed, a passionate Junior .NET Developer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I have a strong foundation in web development and a growing interest in the potential of AI technologies, particularly in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL).

🔭 Currently, I’m working at the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology since December 2023. In my role, I’ve been focused on developing and maintaining dynamic web applications using ASP.NET Core and enhancing system performance with Entity Framework.

💡 Key Skills:

Web Development: ASP.NET Core, C#, MVC, SQL Server
Front-End Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX
Database Management: Entity Framework, MySQL, SQL Server
Software Development: RESTful APIs, Git, Docker, Microservices
Machine Learning: Python (actively learning)
📄 My work includes projects that have significantly improved code performance and contributed to achieving departmental goals. For example, I recently updated a legacy .NET 4.1 project to .NET 8, adding new features that showcase the achievements of my department.

🌱 I’m constantly learning and exploring new technologies to expand my skill set. I’m particularly excited about the intersection of web development and AI, where I’m actively working on personal projects involving ML and DL.
