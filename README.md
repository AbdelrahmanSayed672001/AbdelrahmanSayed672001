<h1><strong>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</strong></h1>

 <h2><strong>ðŸš€About Me</strong></h2>

ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Abdelrahman Sayed, a passionate Junior .NET Developer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I have a strong foundation in web development and a growing interest in the potential of AI technologies, particularly in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL).

ðŸ”­ Currently, Iâ€™m working at the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology since December 2023. In my role, Iâ€™ve been focused on developing and maintaining dynamic web applications using ASP.NET Core and enhancing system performance with Entity Framework.

<strong>ðŸ’¡ Key Skills:</strong>

- <strong>Web Development:</strong> ASP.NET Core, C#, MVC, SQL Server
Front-End Technologies:</strong> HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX
- <strong>Database Management:</strong> Entity Framework, MySQL, SQL Server
- <strong>Software Development:</strong> RESTful APIs, Git, Docker, Microservices
- <strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Python (actively learning)

ðŸ“„ My work includes projects that have significantly improved code performance and contributed to achieving departmental goals. For example, I recently updated a legacy .NET 4.1 project to .NET 8, adding new features that showcase the achievements of my department.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m constantly learning and exploring new technologies to expand my skill set. Iâ€™m particularly excited about the intersection of web development and AI, where Iâ€™m actively working on personal projects involving ML and DL.
